this is a small project in TIKE cloud platform(Time series Integrated Knowledge Engine) .
the dataset is MAST data which is stored in cloud .
Here we are looking at a particular HST observation .
after finding the desired file we are looking for the file's cloud url i.e its location at S3 server . 
then we read the data from the file and after storing the data we set the limits to the image and then plot it.
